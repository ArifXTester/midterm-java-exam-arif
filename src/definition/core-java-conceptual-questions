Please answer the below core-java Questions:

What jdk contains or composed of and define each components?
A.

1. Java Virtual Machine (JVM): It executes Java bytecode.
2. Java Runtime Environment (JRE): It's needed to run Java apps.
3. Java Compiler (javac): It compiles Java source code.
4. Java API Libraries: These provide core functionality.
5. Development Tools: Tools for coding and debugging.
6. Utilities: Tools like keytool, jar, etc.
7. Sample Code and Demos: Such as example programs.
8. Documentation: These provide detailed Java language resources.



What is IDE?

Explain the entire java life cycle.
A.
1. Writing Code: Developers write Java code using a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
2. Saving Code: The Java code is saved with a .java extension.
3. Compiling: The Java Compiler (javac) is used to compile the .java source code files into bytecode files with a .class extension. This step checks for syntax errors.
4. Bytecode: The compiled bytecode is platform-independent and can be executed on any system with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
5. Running: The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) executes the bytecode by loading the .class files. It converts bytecode into machine-specific instructions for execution.
6. Execution: The Java program runs, performing the tasks specified in the code.
7. Output: If the code includes output statements (e.g., print statements), the program generates output that can be displayed on the screen or saved to files.
8. Termination: The program completes its execution and terminates.

Throughout this life cycle, developers can edit the Java source code, recompile it,
and run it again to test and refine their programs.  The compiled bytecode can be executed
on different systems AS LONG AS a compatible JVM is available.

Q. What is class?
